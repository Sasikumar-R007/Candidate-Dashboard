## 🔧 Configuration Details

### WebSocket Configuration (Replit Environment)
```typescript
// Located in: server/db.ts
neonConfig.webSocketConstructor = CustomWebSocket;
neonConfig.pipelineConnect = false;
```

### Database Connection
```typescript
// Located in: server/db.ts
export const pool = new Pool({ 
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL 
});
export const db = drizzle({ client: pool, schema });
```

### Drizzle Configuration
```typescript
// Located in: drizzle.config.ts
{
  out: "./migrations",
  schema: "./shared/schema.ts",
  dialect: "postgresql",
  dbCredentials: {
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URL
  }
}
```

## 📝 Current Data Status

Your database is currently **empty** and ready for use:
- ✅ All tables created
- ✅ Schema synced
- ✅ No test data remaining
- ✅ Ready for production use

## 🚀 How to Use Your Database

### 1. In Your Backend Code (server/routes.ts)
```typescript
import { db } from './db';
import { users, profiles } from '@shared/schema';

// Create a user
const newUser = await db.insert(users).values({
  username: 'john_doe',
  password: hashedPassword
}).returning();

// Read users
const allUsers = await db.query.users.findMany();

// Update a user
const updated = await db.update(users)
  .set({ password: newHashedPassword })
  .where(eq(users.id, userId))
  .returning();

// Delete a user
await db.delete(users).where(eq(users.id, userId));
```

### 2. Push Schema Changes
When you modify `shared/schema.ts`:
```bash
npm run db:push
```

### 3. Direct SQL Queries (if needed)
```typescript
const result = await pool.query('SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10');
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Environment Variable:** Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is set in your Replit secrets
2. **WebSocket Config:** Already configured for Replit environment
3. **SSL Certificates:** Custom WebSocket handles SSL properly
4. **Schema Sync:** Use `npm run db:push` to sync schema changes

## 🎯 Next Steps

Your database is fully configured and ready! You can now:

1. ✅ Start building your API endpoints in `server/routes.ts`
2. ✅ Create users, profiles, and other records
3. ✅ Build your frontend to interact with the database
4. ✅ Deploy to production when ready
