"Convert this single-profile application into a multi-user/multi-tenant SaaS platform where:

User Isolation: Each user (Recruiter, Team Leader, Admin, etc.) has their own unique account with separate login credentials
Data Ownership: All data (requirements, closures, resumes, revenue, performance metrics, candidates, etc.) is tied to the specific user who owns it
Profile Uniqueness: When Recruiter "John" logs in, only John's dashboard, name, stats, and data appear - not shared with Recruiter "Ken"
Session-Based Data Access: All API endpoints should fetch and store data based on the currently logged-in user's session (employeeId)
Eliminate Shared State: Remove all hardcoded static profiles and in-memory storage that is shared across users"
Root Cause of the Current Problem
Looking at your code, I found the issue. In server/routes.ts, there's a static in-memory object for the recruiter profile:

// Line 2218-2232 in routes.ts
let recruiterProfile = {
  id: "rec-001",
  name: "Kumaravel R",  // ← This is SHARED for ALL recruiters!
  role: "Talent Advisor",
  employeeId: "STTA005",
  // ...
};

When ANY recruiter calls /api/recruiter/profile, they ALL get this same object. When one updates it, EVERYONE sees the update.

Implementation Plan (Step-by-Step)
Phase 1: Foundation - Fix Profile-Based Data Access
Step	Task	Description
1.1	Remove static profiles	Delete the hardcoded recruiterProfile and similar static objects
1.2	Use session-based lookups	Modify /api/recruiter/profile to fetch from employees table using req.session.employeeId
1.3	Add user-scoped profile updates	When updating profile, update the specific employee's record in the database
Phase 2: Data Ownership - Link All Data to Users
Step	Task	Description
2.1	Verify schema relationships	Ensure tables like requirements, revenueMappings, targetMappings have proper talentAdvisorId or recruiterId foreign keys
2.2	Filter data by logged-in user	Modify all API endpoints to filter data using WHERE talentAdvisorId = :loggedInEmployeeId
2.3	Store data with user ownership	When creating new records, automatically attach the logged-in user's ID
Phase 3: Dashboard Data Isolation
Step	Task	Description
3.1	Recruiter Dashboard	Metrics (closures, revenue, performance) filtered to current recruiter
3.2	Team Leader Dashboard	See only their own team members and aggregated data
3.3	Admin Dashboard	Can see all users and has cross-user visibility
Phase 4: Frontend Session Handling
Step	Task	Description
4.1	Auth Context	Store logged-in user info in React context after login
4.2	Protected Routes	Redirect to login if session expired
4.3	Display User Info	Show logged-in user's name/role in header/sidebar
How It Will Work After Implementation
John (Recruiter) logs in:
├── Session stores: employeeId = "john-uuid-123"
├── GET /api/recruiter/profile → Returns John's data from employees table
├── GET /api/requirements → Returns requirements WHERE talentAdvisorId = "john-uuid-123"
├── POST /api/requirements → Creates with talentAdvisorId = "john-uuid-123"
└── Dashboard shows: "John" + John's stats only
Ken (Recruiter) logs in:
├── Session stores: employeeId = "ken-uuid-456"
├── GET /api/recruiter/profile → Returns Ken's data from employees table
├── GET /api/requirements → Returns requirements WHERE talentAdvisorId = "ken-uuid-456"
└── Dashboard shows: "Ken" + Ken's stats only
